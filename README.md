After cloning the GitHub repo to my local machine, Use the command `touch hello.txt` to create the file.
Use the different file editors like vi, vim, or emacs to make changes to the created file if on git CLI.
For Visual Studio Code, go to the editor group section and click add the file which you'll name `hello.txt`. Click on the new file, make changes, and push it to the remote repo.
